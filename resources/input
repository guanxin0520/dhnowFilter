							<content:encoded><![CDATA[Resignation beyond sorrow on the Facebook Platform and beyond &mdash; In recent weeks, Facebook has been sending emails imploring me to complete a survey about how they might improve their development platform. I'd been deleting the messages, but after the third request or so, I decided to click through. For those lucky enough to have avoided it, the Facebook Platform is a set of tools and services that allows developers to build software that lives atop or connects to Facebook. I've already got a good measure of existential dread built around Facebook as a platform, but the ongoing badgering burst my bile bubble. The first survey question asked "Why would...

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The idea that generations of Shakespeare scholars got it all wrong appeals to the Saturday morning &#8220;kids rule!&#8221; ethos, where the kids look into the camera and wink, adult authorities are easily duped, and the bad guys foreclosing on the pizza parlor can be thwarted by dumping a bucket of water on their legal documents.

No matter how often they are Ñ you might think Ñ overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary, these arguments find new advocates, are reanimated, get unsteadily to their feet, and stumble groggily onwards.</p>
<p>A prime example of such a zombie is the denial that the plays of Shakespeare were written by William Shakespeare, and the accompanying claim that in fact they were written by Francis Bacon, or the Earl of Oxford, or Christopher Marlowe, or even Queen Elizabeth I. It&#8217;s worth just pausing for a moment, as we stand on the brink of an engagement with these assertions and before we have begun to consider their glaring weaknesses, to summarise the evidence for the straightforward view that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him. &#8211;<a href='http://standpointmag.co.uk/books-july-august-13-the-zombie-argument-that-refuses-to-die-david-womersley-bard'>Standpoint</a>.</p></img>]]></content:encoded>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer, my family and I rented a lake house for a few weeks. We were excited to have a grill, and at first, we took serious advantage: burgers, chicken, kebobs, barbecue, etc. But we soon ran up against two problems: meat fatigue and a fridge full of leftovers. Between the two of us, my wife and I have a number of standby techniques for disposing of miscellaneous leftovers, but most (like frittatas and stir fry) require making the house even hotter with a hot stove.</p>
<p>Pizza to the rescue! We got the idea early in our trip to try making pizza on the grill. It turned out so well that we ended up doing it a number of times. Not only was it a good way to get rid of just about any grilled leftovers, but it was legitimately good pizza in its own right &#8211; even when some of the ingredients we used were kinda cheap.</p>
<p>Arriving at the best technique was the biggest challenge. I&#8217;ve described the process below. We had a propane grill, which was helpful for heat control, but you could do it with charcoal and it&#8217;d probably taste better.</p>
<p><strong>Get a dough</strong> &#8211; We got our doughs from the local pizza joint. You could make it yourself, but it&#8217;s a pain to make pizza dough, and so cheap to buy it. I&#8217;ve bought doughs from at least a half dozen pizzerias, and I&#8217;ve never paid more than $4 for a large one. As long as it&#8217;s a non-chain joint that does reasonable business, you know the dough will be fresh, and prepared with more expertise than if you&#8217;d done it yourself. (Some grocery stores sell pizza doughs. I&#8217;ve never bought one, so I can&#8217;t vouch &#8211; but I have noticed that they&#8217;re generally pretty small. Also, you can buy premade crusts, but is lame, as it takes away the biggest advantage of the grill, namely that it gets hot enough to cook a crust properly.)</p>
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0139.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0139-1024x680.jpg" alt="Dough" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2037" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Get a large dough from a local pizzeria. Price: $2-4.</p>
<p><strong>Get the rest of your ingredients</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;ll need:</p>

<em>Sauce</em> &#8211; We used cheap jarred sauce. Plain crushed tomatoes would probably be even better. Once we made a pie with leftover pulled pork, and I used a thin layer of barbecue sauce instead.
<em>Cheese</em> &#8211; We had our best results with Polly-O mozzarella, either grated large or cut into very thin strips/slices. The pre-shredded stuff is a big question mark &#8211; could be fine, but could be pretty dry (that is, <em>too</em> dry &#8211; good pizza cheese should be a bit dried). You can use another cheese as an accent, like a bit of goat cheese.
<em>Toppings</em> &#8211; Whatever you have laying around. Once we made something pretty fancy (some chi-chi salami), but usually it was whatever meat and veggies we&#8217;d grilled the day before. If it&#8217;s a bit limp after sitting in the fridge, give it a quick saut before using. Fresh herbs are nice too.
<em>Oil</em> &#8211; We used olive oil at a couple different points in the process, as described below.

<p><strong>Get your mise en place together</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m typically cavalier about getting stuff in place before cooking, but with grilled pizza it&#8217;s crucial. The steps below can be fast and furious, and you won&#8217;t have time to stumble drunkenly to the fridge to get ingredients.</p>
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0140.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0140-1024x680.jpg" alt="Mise en place" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2038" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Get it together. High Life optional but recommended</p>
<p><strong>Preheat, clean, and oil the grill</strong> &#8211; Turn it up as high as it goes. The reason why you&#8217;re able to make decent pizza on the grill, but not in your oven, is because the grill gets a few hundred degrees hotter. Give it at least 15 minutes to get blazing hot (or more, depending on how your grill works). Make sure it&#8217;s clean and well-oiled, or your crust will stick and break.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch the dough</strong> &#8211; There are lots of ways to turn a ball of dough into something resembling a pizza. My preferred technique is to stretch it to a disc, then hold it vertically by the edge, letting the dough fall downward while stretching the cornicione a little bit. Keep turning and stretching, allowing gravity do most of the work but helping to keep a pretty uniform thickness. Basically, make the crust as big and thin as you can without breaking and without being too big for your grill.</p>
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0144.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0144-1024x680.jpg" alt="Almost ready to flip" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2042" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Almost ready to flip</p>
<p><strong>First grilling</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s time to give a quick sear to what will end up being the top of the pizza. Lay the stretched dough on the grill. (It&#8217;s flexible, so now&#8217;s the time to make that circularish dough into a rectangularish shape, if that&#8217;s how your grill is shaped.) Brush the exposed side of the dough with olive oil. Then close the lid. Let it cook for maybe a minute, then check the upskirt. Once it&#8217;s charred to your liking, <em>turn the burners all the way down</em> &#8211; this&#8217;ll be important in a second. Use a big long spatula to make sure the whole crust is loose from the grill, and then use that same spatula (along with some tongs, or your hands) to flip the crust over.</p>
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0145.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0145-1024x680.jpg" alt="Upskirt" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2043" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Upskirt (that&#8217;s a technical term)</p>
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0146.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0146-1024x680.jpg" alt="Post-flip" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2044" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Post-flip</p>
<p><strong>Top the pizza</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;ve turned the burners way down, but the grates are still very hot. You&#8217;ll want to top the pizza as quickly as possible, so you can get the lid closed and the cheese melted before the bottom has a chance to burn. Brush the pie with oil. Then sauce and cheese &#8211; if you put the cheese down first, it melts a little better, but it&#8217;s harder to then spread the sauce, so experiment to your liking. Then the toppings. It&#8217;s helpful to have two people working here, one doing the oil, the other following right behind with sauce, and so on.
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0147.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0147-1024x680.jpg" alt="Topped" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2045" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Topped and ready for the second cooking</p>
<p><strong>Let it cook</strong> &#8211; Close the lid and crank the heat up all the way again. Because the grill cooled a lot while you had it open to flip and top (when the heat was turned down), this second cooking will take a bit longer than the first. Check the pizza after two or three minutes. You&#8217;re looking for two things: the cheese should be adequately melted, and the bottom of the crust should look adequately done. If it seems like the crust is cooking too fast, turn down the heat.</p>
<a href="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0149.jpg"><img src="http://teleogistic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0149-1024x680.jpg" alt="Voil" width="625" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-2047" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Voil</p>
<p><strong>Remove and dress</strong> &#8211; Get a platter, and use your big spatula to get the pizza off of the grill. Depending on size and thickness of crust, it should be pretty firm and easy to handle. This is when I like to dress with basil and a drizzling of oil. Some Parmasean or Romano cheese would also be good.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the pies we made over the course of our stay:

<p>Unless you&#8217;ve got a special oven made for cooking pizza in your kitchen, the technique described above is likely to get you the best home-cooked pizza you can make. It&#8217;s a cheap and delicious way to put leftovers to good use. Hop to it, before grilling season is over!</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.cgbrooke.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/AHAcomic.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-458 " alt="a little comic about the AHA embargo fiasco" src="http://www.cgbrooke.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/AHAcomic.jpg" width="578" height="237" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">a little comic about the AHA embargo fiasco</p>
<p>I am not an historian, nor a member of AHA, nor an early-stage scholar, nor a publisher, nor am I responsible for library acquisitions. But then, the same can be said of plenty of folk who have weighed in on the decision by the American Historical Association to release <a href="http://blog.historians.org/2013/07/american-historical-association-statement-on-policies-regarding-the-embargoing-of-completed-history-phd-dissertations/" target="_blank">a statement</a> allowing for (and by implication, perhaps, endorsing) the &#8220;embargo&#8221; of history dissertations. As <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/07/26/dissertation-embargoes-and-the-rights-of-scholars-aha-smacks-the-hornets-nest/" target="_blank">Rick Anderson</a> notes (in a Scholarly Kitchen post that provides a pretty strong overview), the AHA &#8220;smack[ed] the hornet&#8217;s nest.&#8221; I follow enough Digital Humanities and Open Access inclined historians on Twitter that this statement, and the furor that ensued, registered substantially throughout my feed. And over the past week or so, the discussion has trickled upwards to the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/aha-asks-what-about-children" target="_blank">usual</a> <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Scholarly-Group-Seeks-Up-to/140515/" target="_blank">suspects</a>Ê(and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/13/07/american-historical-association-universities-ought-to-embargo-dissertations-from-the-internet-for-6-years/278024/" target="_blank">beyond!</a>) and sideways to other disciplines. At least it has to my own, based on listserv discussions and retweets.</p>
<p>And it should spread, because it&#8217;s not just an issue for historians. Times for university presses and for academic libraries are tough all over, and that affects every discipline. As someone who routinely advises late-stage graduate students and untenured faculty, I think that the questions raised by the AHA statement are ones that everyone in the humanities should be thinking about, not just members of that particular organization. For a good cross-section of the various positions and issues, my best recommendation is <a href="http://openhistory.uservoice.com/forums/216483-ahagate-collection" target="_blank">Open History</a>, a project that began as part of the backlash against the AHA statement, but one that I&#8217;ll be watching with interest. They&#8217;ve got a pretty thorough collection of the responses to date, and a mechanism for adding others (addressing a weakness of the link round-up posts I&#8217;ve seen). I&#8217;m thinking about using that &#8220;issue&#8221; in my DH course for next spring, incidentally.</p>
<p>I have a couple of thoughts, neither of which necessarily addresses the core issues at play in the Statement or the responses to it. The first is that, put simply, I think discussions like these reveal their scale-free status, or at least raise the question of scale. As I&#8217;ve been sorting through what I want to do with my network rhetorics project, I&#8217;ve been returning to some of the terms and ideas that I&#8217;ve been taking for granted, and one of those is this idea of scale. We describe random networks as having scale whenÊyou can select any of the nodes and treat them as roughly representative of each of the nodes in the network; in other words, the behavior of a given node &#8220;scales up&#8221; as typical to the network itself. In a scale-free network, however, you can&#8217;t generalize from the behavior of a single node to the network. Easy enough, right?</p>
<p>Whether we treat the system addressed by the AHA Statement as a single network, or see it as a set of overlapping networks of various stakeholders (graduate students, faculty, universities, publishers, libraries, et al.), those networks are scale-free, which makes framing any discussion problematic. Insofar as we can speak of a system here, it&#8217;s difficult for me to see any particular node or group of nodes as typical. I don&#8217;t think there are many among us in the academy who would be arrogant enough to describe their own writing process, hiring process(es), job histories, departmental and college relationships, publication records as typical ofÊ<em>all of their colleagues</em>, not in academia, their own field, nor even their own department. Part of how scale-free networks function is iterative&#8211;the status of a given network affects its future development. So, for example, highly trafficked websites are more likely to attract additional traffic&#8211;our experience of the web isn&#8217;t random (or scaled). Each stakeholder in this conversation has a variety of factors to balance, and the ratio among them is a decision that happens locally, based on circumstance, and that ratio necessarily shifts over time.</p>
<p>I know that this sounds painfully self-evident (different Xs behave differently!), but you can see a certain amount of incommensurability that creeps into the discussion. We can&#8217;t speak in generalized terms about the policies of academic presses, so we push for specific evidence. But because those specifics don&#8217;t scale, they can never function beyond the level of anecdote, and ultimately make it more difficult to speak in generalized terms. I work in a field where perhaps the best-selling book of all time (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cross-Talk-Comp-Theory-Reader-3rd/dp/0814109772/" target="_blank">Cross-Talk in Comp Theory</a>, now in its 3rd edition) is not published by a university press but a professional organization, 95% of which appeared in print prior to its inclusion in that volume, and is almost entirely available to anyone for free provided they have access to JSTOR. And that tells you exactly <em>nothing</em> about NCTE&#8217;s own editorial policies, much less the other presses in our field, much less academic presses in general.</p>
<p>In the absence of representative anecdotes, what can be done? Do arguments like this get to a point where we should just throw up our hands? Not really. I do think, though, that at a certain point, networks of arguments hit a threshold where incommensurability sets in. When that happens, a different kind of argument takes place. And maybe this is my second point: lemons are to lemonade as scale-free arguments are to scale (as in &#8220;when life gives you X, you make Y&#8221;). While a number of people have responded to the AHA Statement as a particular kind of intervention (endorsing a rapidly deteriorating and increasingly obsolete model of scholarly communication), I wonder if it&#8217;s more appropriate to think of it as an attempt to introduce scale into the discussion, to establish some kind of baseline that allows us to say certain things about the typical behavior of that system. Bear with me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an imperfect analogy, to be sure, but think about professional sports, and the effects achieved through salary caps. It&#8217;s still hard to speak of the typical franchise in, say, the NBA (the Celtics and Lakers are not representative, e.g.), but a salary cap mitigates the scale-free quality of the network of franchises, allowing Oklahoma City to compete with Los Angeles, even if the two take very different approaches to team development, talent acquisition, etc. Even though teams may appear to ignore the cap (hello, Brooklyn!), the penalties for doing so are not insubstantial (increased luxury taxes, the inability to sign players for more than the league minimum, etc.), and can&#8217;t be maintained indefinitely. The salary cap doesn&#8217;t homogenize the league nor guarantee any sort of sustained success for a franchise, but it does level the field in terms of opportunity. There are still strategies and tactics involved, but there&#8217;s sufficient scale in the network (we might argue) to allow every team to compete.</p>
<p>Part of the AHA Statement, then, is about scale: all graduates should be able to choose what to do with their dissertations. In <em>this</em> sense, the AHA Statement isn&#8217;t so far away from guidelines offered by the MLA regarding <a href="http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_it/dig_eval" target="_blank">the value of digital work</a>:</p>
<p>Institutions and departments should develop written guidelines so that faculty members who create, study, and teach with digital objects; engage in collaborative work; or use technology for pedagogy can be adequately and fairly evaluated and rewarded. The written guidelines should provide clear directions for appointment, reappointment, merit increases, tenure, and promotion and should take into consideration the growing number of resources for evaluating digital scholarship and the creation of born-digital objects.</p>
<p>If your department or discipline falls under the MLA umbrella, then this provides a pretty clear statement about the importance and value of digital work&#8211;whether or not every single department follows this Statement to the letter, MLA provides a baseline for the responsible evaluation of tenure/promotion cases that include such work. It doesn&#8217;t say, however, that you should not be tenuredÊ<em>unless</em> you do such work, or that folks who don&#8217;t work digitally are less likely to be tenured. If I were forced to name the difference between these two sets of claims, perhaps I&#8217;d call them policy statements and position statements. The MLA here is setting policy, or at least offering a Statement that itself can be adopted and adapted to policy on the local level.</p>
<p>Where the hornet&#8217;s nest gets smacked with the AHA Statement, I think, is precisely those moments when it drifts away from policy towards position:</p>
<p>an increasing number of university presses are reluctant to offer a publishing contract to newly minted PhDs whose dissertations have been freely available via online sources&#8230;.online dissertations that are free and immediately accessible make possible a form of distribution that publishers consider too widespread to make revised publication in book form viable&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly controversial to note that, if your interest is in crafting policy, the phrase &#8220;tangible threat&#8221; is not the best choice. <img src='http://www.cgbrooke.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  If nothing else, that phrase alone functions deictically, calling attention to the specific circumstances surrounding the Statement and inviting the polarization that occurred in response. It treats those circumstances not as variable or conditional (which they surely are, if others&#8217; responses are to be trusted), but as given. And it turns the policy into an outgrowth of a position that is conjectural (and which proved to be controversial). I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d go so far as to say that it&#8217;s simply a matter of tone, but it&#8217;s hard for me to imagine that there would have been nearly as much outcry, if the Statement had presented the policy as a necessary update given the shifts in scholarly communication/technology. I think that the case (and the policy) could have been made without implying that OA advocates&#8217; beliefs constitute a (tangible!) threat to their newer colleagues.</p>
<p>If I were to put a bow on this, I think I&#8217;m slowly articulating an idea for myself about network rhetorics: this notion of making an argument to scale is something that I find coming up again and again, one that only really emerges with clarity when you think about arguments ecologically or as networked. I still don&#8217;t quite have the vocabulary for it yet, but most networks don&#8217;t occupy either the random or the scale-free end of the spectrum; they&#8217;re semi-scaled, maybe, and maybe I&#8217;m thinking about scale as a consequence of rhetoric. That may be the next puzzle piece for me as I work on my next book. I wish I had a witty remark to insert here about my failure to embargo this post, but let your imagination run wild&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all.</p>

</p><p>Two weeks ago, I had the privilege to teach a three-hour workshop titled &#8220;<a title="Pollak Library Guides | Social Media for Nonprofits" href="http://libraryguides.fullerton.edu/social-media-nonprofits">Nonprofits Social Media Toolbox</a>&#8221; for the annual Cal State Fullerton (my employer) <a title="CSUF Summer School for Nonprofits" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/nonprofitsummerschool/">Summer School for Nonprofits</a>. The workshop provided an overview of some of the innovative social tools available to nonprofits, and showcased innovative social media examples by nonprofits.</p>
<p>One session of the workshop focused on how nonprofits (and not-for-profits) can make good use of Instagram. Following is a still-evolving Storify I pulled together for the workshop and embedded into my corresponding <a title="Pollak Library Guides | Social Media for Nonprofits" href="http://libraryguides.fullerton.edu/social-media-nonprofits">workshop guide</a>. I continue to add good examples as I find them, so be sure to <a title="Storify | Instagram for Nonprofits" href="http://storify.com/colleengreene/social-media-for-nonprofits-instagram">subscribe to my Storify</a> if this topic is of interest to you.</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post began as thank you to <a href="http://lovefola.com" target="_blank">Folasade Adeoso</a> for <a href="http://diasporahypertext.com/2013/07/26/attribution-part-i-the-art-of-folasade-adeoso/" target="_blank">allowing me to use an image she created as my Twitter cover image (@jmjafrx) and as the Diaspora Hypertext, the Blog icon</a>.</p>
<p>But it became something more as I reflected on why a post like that was necessary and on what it means to <a href="https://talk.alliedmedia.org/es/amc2013/sessions/web-writing-ownership-ethics-and-power" target="_blank">make media</a> and scholarship in the presence of and in the shadow of power. What does it mean for me to ask permission, to receive it, to attribute ideas to their proper owners? To make sure every blog post carries citations or credit for any images, quotes, and screen captures? Artist-thinkers from Bettina Judd to Moya Bailey to Katherine McKittrick have discussed the <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/meridians/v011/11.2.judd02.html" target="_blank">politics</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/moyazb/status/256036624679452674" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com/2011/04/13/on-ashley-judd-and-the-politics-of-citation/" target="_blank">citation</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0RVPfDtlnNMC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=%22politics+of+citation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-f7ZvKVMYG&amp;sig=WrN3r6TWI88ew-hdBl4mv4wb7B8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3AH0UenjEpHO9ASv2oCADw&amp;ved=0CMQBEOgBMBM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22politics%20of%20citation%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">before</a>. Adeoso discussed some of the same herself in her interview with <a href="http://www.okayafrica.com/2013/04/17/african-art-folasade-adeoso-digital-art-destinys-child-tumblr-intervie/9/" target="_blank">OkayAfrica</a>:</p>
<p>One thing thatÕs so sad about tumblr is that credits get lost. IÕm learning: I keep the original photoshopped file; I set up my tumblr page; IÕm owning this. I made this image of Grace Jones, using the Bulletproof album cover which I cropped. One day I went on tumblr and this image had like 2000 reblogs, and I would never had known! People donÕt understand, it hurts! I probably didnÕt sleep all night because I was making that and you just took it and put it on your blog. Like Erykah Badu said, IÕm an artist and IÕm sensitive about my shit. [The person apologized &amp; added a credit]</p>
<p>Read the <a href="http://www.okayafrica.com/2013/04/17/african-art-folasade-adeoso-digital-art-destinys-child-tumblr-intervie/9/" target="_blank">rest of the interview here</a>.</p>
<p>Tumblr is my preferred blogging platform and what she said resonated with me. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://lati-negros.tumblr.com" target="_blank">LatiNegr@s Project</a> home base and where I&#8217;m trying to build <a href="http://diasporahypertext.com/category/the-codex/" target="_blank">the Codex</a>. But tension around politics of citation, especially where it involves women and genderqueer people of color, social media, and proper attribution has flared white hot for weeks now. These politics were on display, again, just a couple weeks ago when Genie Lauren (<a href="http://twitter.com/moreandagain" target="_blank">@MoreandAgain</a>) <a href="http://bit.ly/13h3gJD" target="_blank">created a petition to stop Juror B37&#8242;s book deal, posting the name and phone number of her literary agent on Twitter</a>. The offer was rescinded, but the event was reported by major media sites like BuzzFeed <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/zimmerman-juror-decides-not-to-write-a-book" target="_blank">as though the book deal ended because of a near spontaneous decision made by the Juror B37</a>&#8211;not as though Lauren played <a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/melissa-harris-perry/52536077" target="_blank">a significant, activist role</a> in having the offer pulled.</p>
<p>More recently, in an article for Gawker, <a href="http://gawker.com/video-of-violent-rioting-surfers-shows-white-culture-o-954939719" target="_blank">Cord Jefferson</a> plagirized, nearly word-for-word, analysis and wit by longtime Twitter wordsmithÊ <a href="http://twitter.com/thewayoftheid" target="_blank">@thewayoftheid</a>. When Jefferson and Gawker were confronted by @thewayoftheid on social media, their first response was to condescend to and denigrate both the accusation and the accuser. Tracy Clayton reported on the situation for <a href="http://www.theroot.com/blogs/grapevine/gawker-versus-black-twitter" target="_blank">The Root</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px">&#8220;Whoever was manning Gawker&#8217;s Twitter account shot down the accusation, calling it &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gawker/status/362256053829767168">bulls&#8211;t</a>.&#8221; They went on to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gawker/status/362258056484106241">counteraccuse</a> the Twitterer of plagiarism, and Gawker writer Rich Juzwiak <a href="https://twitter.com/RichJuz/status/362258888373960704">joined in the fray</a>, screaming about how nobody knows who @TheWayOfTheId is. (I guess because big news outlets never take from smaller nameless content producers?)&#8221;</p>
<p>[The storify referenced is <a href="http://storify.com/AngryBlackLady/thewayoftheid-is-concerned-about-white-people" target="_blank">available here</a> courtesy of Imani Gandy (@AngryBlackLady on Twitter and Senior Legal Analyst at RH Reality Check)]</p>
<p>Politics of citation are coming up again and again and again as big media triangulates with social media and the intellectual genius of woc and qpoc on the internet. The appropriation of ideas across the internet requires the willful unseeing of non-white voices online&#8211;making it clear that yes, in fact, <a href="http://vanilla.dhpoco.org/discussion/26/week-2-readings-and-summary-of-tara-mcphersons-why-are-the-digital-humanities-so-white" target="_blank">racism does still exist, even on the internet</a>. This willful unseeing is made even more possible <strong>through a racialized condescension toward and demeaning of the <em>way</em> woc and qpoc interact online</strong>. Cursing, twerking, yelling (writing in all caps) or using shorthand internet slang, snarking in 140 character bursts&#8211;our dozens are fun, sexy, and intellectual only to the extent we stay in our lane (referencing pop culture or very current events like #PaulaDeanDishes). But it isn&#8217;t seen as serious work.</p>
<p>The very act of inhabiting social media sites like Twitter or Tumblr, as opposed to writing for a major publication or hosting a blog (or teaching in a classroom) seems to give big media sites and other readers/watchers/lurkers permission to dismiss those speaking/tweeting/Tumbling as though they have nothing worthwhile to say even as their labor is subsumed by others more credentialed, capitalized, with bigger megaphones.</p>
<p>Even among digital humanists, with notable exceptions like Chris Long (<a href="http://twitter.com/cplong" target="_blank">@cplong</a>), social media is seen as a means to an end or a fun corollary to more serious #dh work like databasing or coding.</p>
<p>Social media is fun but it is also labor. It is how I (and many others) engage the digital humanities. It is time-consuming and messy, often vulgar and full of typos. That doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t deserve proper acknowledgement or isn&#8217;t intellectual.</p>
<p>Social media or otherwise, attribution is a baseline for scholarly production and should be a baseline for online interaction. Providing footnotes, requesting permission, and adding citations isn&#8217;t difficult. It isn&#8217;t time consuming. It does require forethought and a recognition that there is real work behind everything found on the internet. It means acknowledging a politics of citation, of discussing, sharing, attributing work is always at play when we share online and in the midst of those politics <strong>some voices are always rendered invisible</strong>. It means challenging internalized assumptions&#8211;likely imported from &#8216;real life&#8217; and the way society privileges politics created in the classroom, the boardroom, and the senate chamber over the corner, the barber shop, or the laundromat&#8211;about where knowledge is being created online and the role social media plays in intellectual production. And for those of us blogging and sharing as academics, it requires a determination to face down our own ability to oppress and silence even in our most well-meaning discussions.</p>
<p>When I discussed #femfuture in a <a href="http://diasporahypertext.com/2013/04/12/femfuture-history-loving-each-other-harder/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I wrote a coda to academic feminists. That coda was also meant to ping academic bloggers in general, especially those making media related to black history and Atlantic slavery. We deal in memory and policy as often as we deal in archive, marking and remarking on territory soaked in blood but covered over in wet cement. We have an obligation to ask ourselves, daily, hourly, and by the Twitter bird minute, &#8220;Why and for whom do you work (online)?&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spent much of my life living near the center of that mitten-shaped peninsula in North America, I have had a consistent seasonal metronome through which I track the years of my life.  When I stitch together what can be an impersonal snapshot of an entire planet, all of the sudden I see a thing with a heartbeat. I can track one location throughout a year to compare the annual push and pull of snow and plant life there, while in my periphery I see the oscillating wave of life advancing and retreating, advancing and retreating.  And I'm reassured by it.</p></img>]]></content:encoded>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>TheÊfollowing is a guest post from Angela Cox, a graduate student inÊEnglish at the University of Arkansas. You can follow her on twitter atÊ<a href="https://twitter.com/KQscholar">@KQscholar</a>. She previously wrote for Play the Past on <a href="http://www.playthepast.org/?p=3834">Space Quest</a>.</em></p>
<p>The very title of the <i>Age of Empires</i> series invites postcolonial readings. Reading real-time strategy (RTS) games from postcolonial frames is nothing new: on this blog, for instance, <a href="http://www.playthepast.org/?p=2509">Trevor</a> and <a href="http://www.playthepast.org/?p=2531">Rebecca</a> have both discussed <i>Colonization</i>; in the journal <i>Game Studies</i>, <a href="http://gamestudies.org/1201/articles/tuur_ghys">Tuur Ghys</a> has suggested that, as a genre, historical RTS games tend to reduce history into a consistent progressive narrative of determinism. <i>Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings</i> and its expansion<i> The Conquerors</i> is complicit with colonial interests in the usual ways: gameplay includes the same sort of technology trees employed in the first <i>Age of Empires</i> game, which Ghys examined in detail, and the conquest-centered gameplay celebrates the colonizerÕs perspective over that of the colonized.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://www.playthepast.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/age-empires-ii-civs.png.jpg" width="111" height="374" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The list of available civilizations, from the Standard Campaign menu with The Conquerors loaded. (Screenshot obtained using FRAPS)</p>
<p>However, I want to use an extension of postcolonial theory, and argue that not only does <i>Age of Empires II</i> (<i>AoEII</i>) position itself clearly in a Euro-centric perspective of the past, in so doing it also inscribes present identities onto past identities, constructing past peoples as a cultural ÒotherÓ in the same way that synchronous societies can construct each other as Òother.Ó In the present time, we have consistently constructed the period we call ÒmedievalÓ as an other to our modernity, just as during the time of the British empire the so-called ÒOrientÓ was constructed as an other for the West (see Edward SaidÕs book <i>Orientalism</i>). This Òothering of timeÓ often seems victimless, but it often perpetuates old stereotypes and colonial damage under the guise of research and historicity.</p>
<p>In <i>AoEII</i>, the othering of time, which constructs in the game a timeless view of the ÒmedievalÓ that is familiar in its construction to the conventional setting of many fantasy and historical narratives, is perpetuated largely through two mechanisms: tokenism and the deployment of uncritical research to establish authority. Tokenism here means creating a display of multiculturalism and cultural sensitivity by including surface features from a number of cultures, but failing to engage in the complexities of cultural interaction in a meaningful way. In <i>AoEII</i>, this appears in the seemingly diverse list of civilizations that the player can choose from, but which make only minimal impact on gameplayÑeach civilization comes with a token special unit, a civilization bonus of some kind (the Celts in <i>AoEII</i>, for instance, retain sheep more easily, playing into countless stereotypes about Celtic cultures and their relationships with sheep), and, in later ages, customized appearances for buildings. Aside from the language in which units respond, though, there is no noticeable difference to the player if he starts the game as the Britons or as the Japanese.</p>
<p>Ttokenism can be dismissed by arguing that the need for ÒbalancedÓ play between the civilizations (and for streamlining the amount of data in the game) outweighs the need for nuance and results in a template civilization with small customizations. The game compensates for this in the written documents that accompany gameplayÑin narrative introductions for scenarios, for instance, or the history section accessible from the main menu that allows the player to read up on (the gameÕs interpretations of) the history of each civilization and on ÒmedievalÓ culture and warfare in general (by which the game generally means Western European). These displays of research establish <i>AoEII</i>Õs authority; the game trades on historical simulation for appeal. But all this historical matter is presented uncritically, without citation or acknowledgement of debate, giving the impression that the history is undisputed fact, common knowledge, and exists without cultural imprint. It is an authoritative voice in the game without apology. Such a presentation works, though, because popular culture values that the research is displayed in such a game; the audience of the game does not value the same trappings that academic history would be presented with. This is an environment where historical material is not sorted or criticized, but merely amassed into a clear narrative. What is valued is the wealth rather than the quality of the research, the presentation of it rather than the provenance of it.</p>
<p>The tokenism and display of research serve in part to recognize that there <i>are</i> distinctions between the civilizations represented in <i>AoEII</i> and its expansion, but at the same time <i>erase</i> certain cultural identities. In particular, by using the Britons as to represent any of the various peoples who could, at various times, be called British, the game effectively erases the identities of those that have historically been marginalized in Great Britain.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture, Units, and Language</strong></p>
<p>The overall design and appearance of the game enforce a Western worldview; the main menu screen, for instance, depicts Tudor architecture and conventionally European trappings of knighthood: heraldic shields, Western blacksmith anvils, and so forth. The history screens are framed with parchment-like design, and sepia sketches in a Western art style depicting European nobility and warfare in most cases. The opening video sequences depict western European castles and warfare. In gameplay itself, the ages and the technology trees depict conventional divisions from European history, and the non-European civilizations are shoe-horned into this gameplay model without apology. Thus, regardless of whatever ages might be germane to a given society, they are nevertheless given a ÒDark AgeÓ followed by a ÒFeudal Age,Ó a ÒCastle Age,Ó and finally an ÒImperial Age.Ó</p>
<img alt="" src="http://www.playthepast.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fig3-euro-screen.png" width="500" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3: The very European looking main menu screen</p>
<p>The game further erases cultural distinctions in having most of the human units look the same (see Figure 4). Buildings all look the same in the ÒDark Age,Ó suggesting that there are primitive phases in every society that are culturally identicalÑor even completely without cultural identity. This, in turn, suggests that civilizations that have not ÒadvancedÓ (as the game calls it) to at least what the game considers the ÒFeudal Age,Ó according to the games deterministic sense of history, have no culture to speak of. In the later ages, buildings have distinction, and the technology trees open up special units for gameplay according to the selected civilization, but even these distinctions are severely limited. There are not as many visual customizations as there are civilizations, so that the buildings in some civilizations are identical to those in others. This can be particularly egregious when the game groups civilizations together that, in actual history, have contentious margins in which there is cultural conflict. For instance, the Japanese, Chinese, and Korean buildings use the same sequence of visual development, erasing distinctions between these East Asian cultures, as do the buildings for the Britons and the CeltsÑboth of which take a strikingly English appearance (see Figure 4).</p>
<img alt="" src="http://www.playthepast.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tables.png" width="500" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4 &#8211; A comparison of the town center building and peasant units in four selected civilizations in AoEII. Note that the snow effect is an artifact of terrain effects, and the colors are artifacts of player positions.</p>
<p>Additionally, each civilizationÕs units respond in spoken languages that are intended to be characteristic of the civilizations being played. These are mostly modern languages as now spoken in the regions that the civilizations are supposed to have occupied. Thus, the Franks speak modern French, a romance language, even though they are, in many instances in the game, intended to represent the Germanic Franks. Although the Celts are called upon to represent the Scottish in the campaigns, they speak modern Irish, conflating the group of cultures that we now call Celtic.</p>
<p>The exception to this modern language according to geography paradigm is the Britons. Because the game is set in a medievalized setting, it might break the suspension of disbelief for these units to respond in modern English, and the game would risk casual players accusing it of not having done research. To compensate for the problem of the popular conception of historicity, the game has them speak, according to a Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/age2/multimedia.htm">website</a>, Middle EnglishÑwhich is here a mix of Old English, Latin, and Middle English (or Anglo-Norman). This portrayal is especially problematic because the term ÒBritonsÓ does not properly refer to the people who spoke Old English, which would be the Anglo-Saxons and who (as the history section of the game acknowledges) came to Britain later than the Britons; Middle English is the language of the Normans and the Anglo-Saxons that the Normans conquered more than the Britons, who by this point have been twice marginalized.</p>
<p>But what is important to the game is not that the language be accurate (which they are not; the translations are also dubious), but rather that it <i>sound right</i> to the audience. It is a conspicuous display of research and multiculturalism rather than accurate or critical research. Critical or rigorous research in the game would actually diminish the authority of the game because the game would not then match the comfortable centralized perspectives of the modern, western audience of the game. The Euro-centric medievalization is comfortable and ÒauthenticÓ to the audience because it is comfortableÑit keeps the medieval as safely other, an identity that the player can comfortably enter without challenging his own identity as modern, and does not present any counternarratives that assert distinct identities for the historical peoples whose names and stories are appropriated for the game.</p>
<p>In the case of the language of the BritonsÕ units, the cultural harm done here is that it effectively erases the identity of the Britons and subsumes it into the identity of the peoples who later conquered them, even when portrayed pre-conquest, as in the case of having them speak Middle English; furthermore, because the game lacks the cultures that would actually speak Middle English or Old English, the Britons are forced to stand in for them in campaigns merely because of geographic proximity.</p>
<p><strong>Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>Of course, the game cannot include every civilization, and the lack of Saxons or Normans would not be noteworthy were it not for the fact that so many of the campaigns are based on historical events in the history of EnglandÑbut not necessarily of the BritonsÑso that the apparent attempt at decentralizing EnglandÕs role as empire-builder actually backfires and forces colonized civilizations to stand in for England in these simulations. Thus, William Wallace leads the modern Irish-speaking Celts in rebellion against the Britons, and (in the expansion) William of Normandy leads the Franks against the Goths and the Vikings at Hastings.</p>
<p>The narration that introduces the campaigns supplies the historically correct civilization names, although, like most of the narration text in the game, it does so in a conventionally accepted Anglo-centric perspective. In the opening narration for the Battle of Hastings campaign, the first two panels read:</p>
<p>Mercenaries and Norman knights look dubiously at the ships that wobble in the black, fog-choked sea. What man is this Duke William to put so many horses on leaky transports? William ignores their questioning glances and stares across the channel in the direction of England. Edward the Confessor is dead and now three men claim rulership of England. Harold he Saxon sits on the English throne and even now hastens to fortify his shores against two invasions.</p>
<p>Here, the Normans and Saxons are accounted for in their historical roles. But, because of the limitations of the available civilizations in the game, when the actual gameplay starts there are no Normans or SaxonsÑthere are instead Franks and Goths, respectively.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://www.playthepast.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fig-4-diplomacy.png" width="500" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 6 &#8211; The civilizations used in the Battle of Hastings scenario. Note the lack of Saxons and Normans. (Note also that the player&#8217;s name substitutes for the name of William of Normandy)</p>
<p>If the Britons are to represent more generally Òthe BritishÓ then this seems a deliberate move to remove judgment about actual right to the Island of Britain by making all the claimants to the throne foreignersÑbut it also leaves Britain an unpopulated land for the claiming. The actual Britons have again been erased, not only subsumed into English (and more generally British) identity, but here actually erased from the land that they inhabited. Likewise, the Franks are being erased at the same time as the Britons, subsumed into more generally Òthe FrenchÓ.</p>
<p>The process here is clear: the game uses a close approximation based on geography, and has chosen the more antique names for the inhabitants of that geography, regardless of ethnicity or history. This is evident in the file names for the historical documentsÑthe file name for the history of the Britons is ÒBritishÓ. However, it might have been more accurate for the game to have the player take on the ÒEnglishÓ or the ÒBritishÓ rather than the ÒBritonsÓ, since several of the scenarios require the presence of the English: William Wallace, Battle of Hastings, and the Battle of Agincourt. Likewise, it would be more accurate to have the French, rather than the Franks, in order to account for The Battle of Hastings, the Battle of Agincourt, and the Joan of Arc campaign. Almost none of the scenarios involve historically situated Franks or Britons.</p>
<p><strong>Histories and Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>As part of the display of research, <i>AoEII</i> includes a ÒHistoryÓ section, accessible from the main menu, in which players can ÒRead about the civilizations in the game, medieval warfare, and more.Ó In this section, the game makes recognition of the oversimplifications that are necessary from the exigencies of balanced gameplay, as its narratives recognize the points of contact between the erased civilizations. This would seem to ameliorate the erasures made for gameplay, but in many ways it perpetuates them.</p>
<p>Here again the Britons are made to stand in for whoever is occupying the Island of Britain: the historical narration is the conventional story of subsequent conquests that is familiar in traditional, imperialistic histories of England: it begins with Roman withdrawal in 400, after which Òthe British Isles fell into a very dark period of several centuriesÓ and, while acknowledging the Celts, resumes history with the Anglo-Saxons, and accounts for Viking and Norman invasion, and ends with the Hundred YearsÕ War with France. All this history is, however, titled ÒThe Britons (500 on)Ó, which makes no recognition that ÒThe BritonsÓ refer to a Celtic group rather than any of the groups that feature centrally in the narrativeÑa narrative more properly named Òthe English.Ó</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sections on Òmedieval warfare and moreÓ are, more precisely, about Western European warfare. In fact, it reads something like an old-fashioned 8th grade Òworld historyÓ textbook with a conventional western bias. There are sections on the ÒDark AgesÓ, on ÒBarbarian InvadersÓ and ÒThe Fall of RomeÓ and finally on ÒFeudalismÕs DeclineÓ and the ÒRenaissance.Ó These are provided in the general history section, and do not work with the cultures outside of the Euro-centric deterministic view of history, such as the Aztecs or the Chinese, despite being lumped with the other civilizations. Thus, the history section, in its design, marginalizes non-Western European civilizations, even as it makes a tokenistic display of inclusivity by including a section on each playable civilization. In so doing, the game continues to erase the contexts and nuances of history, subsuming it all into a comfortable narrative of the Western descent and rise via a Òdark agesÓ and a ÒrenaissanceÓ. Such a narrative affirms our present view of ourselves as progressive and advanced, above the warring civilizations that the game allows us to play-act for a while.</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you follow my blog or Twitter account, you probably know that <a href="http://derekbruff.org/?tag=sketchnotes">I&#8217;m a fan of sketchnotes</a>. Sketchnotes are notes taken during presentations or panels that combine doodles and diagrams and text and typography to capture ideas visually. I learned about sketchnotes a few years ago when I started reading more about visual thinking, and I first tried my hand at sketchnoting <a href="http://derekbruff.org/?p=1471">back in 2011</a>. I&#8217;ve found the practice incredibly useful, both for focusing my attention during talks and for capturing ideas from talks for later reference and use. You can see some of my conference sketchnotes <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/derekbruff/sets/72157632205635269/">over on Flickr</a>, and you can find my sermon sketchnotes (yes, I sketchnote at church!) on <a href="http://derekbruff.org/blogs/sketchnotes/">my &#8220;Doodling in Church&#8221; blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321885112/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321885112&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2699" alt="The Sketchnote Handbook" src="http://derekbruff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ShowCover.aspx_-233x300.jpg" width="233" height="300" /></a>Last December, I picked up Mike Rohde&#8217;s new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321885112/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321885112&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20">The Sketchnote Handbook</a></em>. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about sketchnoting from looking at the notes shared on <a href="http://sketchnotearmy.com/">Sketchnote Army</a>, a blog created by Rohde, and I wanted to see if I could improve my craft by reading Rohde&#8217;s &#8220;illustrated guide to visual note taking.&#8221; Rohde&#8217;s book is an excellent introduction to sketchnoting, and I believe it&#8217;s helped me create more visually interesting notes that do a better job of capturing key ideas from the talks I attend. If you&#8217;re interested in getting into sketchnotes yourself, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Rohde begins by making a persuasive argument for the value of sketchnoting. Like Rohde, I used to take copious amounts of text notes on talks and presentations, filling up pages and pages in legal pads. And like Rodhe, I almost never looked at these notes after the talks were over. These days, I use sketchnotes to distill the main ideas of a talk into one or two pages of visual notes that I actually remember and reference. Rohde points out that the practice of sketchnoting is supported by cognitive science, particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory">dual coding theory</a>. Our brains process verbal and visual information using separate &#8220;channels.&#8221; Taking text notes is a bit like using half your brain power. Capturing ideas in both words and pictures uses more of your brain, helping you better understand and remember those ideas. Sketchnoting isn&#8217;t the only way to listen actively during a talk (I find that live-tweeting helps me do that, too), but it&#8217;s a useful method, and one that produces a product worth sharing and using down the road.</p>
<p>Some people are hesitant to try their hand at sketchnoting because they feel they &#8220;can&#8217;t draw.&#8221; Rodhe points out, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842697/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591842697&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20">as others have</a>, that we all drew as kids and that the quality of drawings we produced as kids are completely sufficient for sketchnotes. &#8220;Kids draw to express ideas,&#8221; writes Rohde. &#8220;They don&#8217;t worry about how perfect their drawings are, as long as their ideas are conveyed&#8221; (p. 15). Later in the book, he distinguishes between <em>structure</em> and <em>art</em><em>. </em>Sketchnotes can feature simple artwork or fancy artwork, but it&#8217;s the structure of the notes that matters most. That&#8217;s why simple lines, circles, arrows, and stick figures can be just as useful as more highly rendered elements of sketchnotes.</p>
<p><a href="http://derekbruff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BQlg3T_CIAAUgcm.jpg-large.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2700" alt="Either way it's still a dog." src="http://derekbruff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BQlg3T_CIAAUgcm.jpg-large-532x300.jpg" width="532" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I should point out here that <em>The Sketchnote Handbook</em> is one giant sketchnote. Rohde combines words and pictures throughout the book very effectively to communicate his ideas and techniques. The book is full of practical advice for the novice sketchnoter. Here are a few takeaways that I&#8217;ve already found valuable:</p>

Live sketchnoting requires you to &#8220;cache&#8221; idea. Sometimes you have to listen for several minutes, processing what the speaker is saying, before you&#8217;re ready to put pen to paper. Holding a few ideas in your head while you make sense of them and see where the speaker is going is a key skill.
Sit strategically. Look for a seat near the middle of a row, so you&#8217;re not disturbed by latecomers, and try to sit under a light source so you can see your notebook clearly. I follow this latter advice all the time at my church, which likes to keep the room lights low during the sermons.
As the talk begins, consider what kind of pattern your notes will take as they fill up the page. Rohde identifies seven common sketchnote patterns: linear, radial, vertical, path, modular, skyscraper, and popcorn. Some talks lend themselves to some patterns more than others, and you can often predict this based on what you know about the format, speaker, and description.
Develop your visual library, the doodles, font styles, and icons you use regularly in your sketchnotes. Rohde&#8217;s book is full of inspiration for doing so. I&#8217;ve already added a couple of extra type faces and arrow styles to my sketchnotes thanks to what I&#8217;ve seen in <em>The Sketchnote Handbook</em>. The book includes examples from Rohde&#8217;s sketchnotes, as well as sketchnotes from at least a dozen other practitioners throughout the book. He also includes a set of visual exercises in his last chapter for practice.

<p>If there&#8217;s a fault in <em>The Sketchnote Handbook</em>, it&#8217;s the lack of attention to the selection of visual metaphors and the use of schematic diagrams to represent relationships. Rohde spends a page on metaphors, but his examples don&#8217;t shed much light on how one would go about identifying a useful visual metaphor. I&#8217;ve found Garr Reynolds&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321811984/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321811984&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20"><em>Presentation Zen </em></a> useful for selecting photos that represent ideas metaphorically, and much of that practice translates to sketchnotes. And while Rohde offers great advice on structuring a page of sketchnotes using his seven patterns, he doesn&#8217;t go into how schematic diagrams using circles, boxes, and lines can effectively convey complex relationships to the extent that Dan Roam does in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842697/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591842697&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=teachwithclas-20">The Back of the Napkin</a>.</em></p>
<p>Even so, I would recommend Mike Rohde&#8217;s handbook to anyone interested in getting started with sketchnotes. You can find out more about the book on <a href="http://rohdesign.com/book/">his homepage</a>, and you can view <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321857897/samplepages/0321857895.pdf">a sample chapter online</a>. Rohde has set up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/thesketchnotehandbook/">a Flickr group</a> for readers of his book to share their sketchnotes, too, which has served as a nice way to develop a community around the book and the practice.</p></img></img>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As an overview, HTML is a hyper text markup language created to give content structure and meaning. CSS, also known as cascading style sheets, is a presentation language created to give content style and appearance.</p>
<p>To put this into laymen terms, HTML determines the structure and meaning of content on a web page while CSS determines the style and appearance of this content. The two languages are independent of one another. CSS should not reside within an HTML document and vice versa.</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have finally be granted a six month research leave and I am now totally immerse int he writing of The Book.One of the things I am reflecting upon is the weight we give to documentary evidences in textual scholarship.&nbsp;The graph below shows in a simplified (and utterly imprecise) way the collocation of some most important editorial theories with respect to the centrality they give to the documentary evidence (the materiality of the text).<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6F3f_DSibac/UfponoZrKWI/AAAAAAAAC0g/hFy2W6G3nPk/s1600/docs-theories.tiff" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="195" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6F3f_DSibac/UfponoZrKWI/AAAAAAAAC0g/hFy2W6G3nPk/s640/docs-theories.tiff" width="640" /></a>Similarly, editorial format can be equally distributed on a continuous line<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Oh14ZQ-spA/UfpotiLmOpI/AAAAAAAAC0o/lSQiGB6H5Gg/s1600/docs-editions.tiff" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Oh14ZQ-spA/UfpotiLmOpI/AAAAAAAAC0o/lSQiGB6H5Gg/s640/docs-editions.tiff" width="640" /></a>&nbsp;While presenting a very complex reality of theoretical positions in an over simplistic way, these graphs have the advantage of showing the path between text and document as a continuum, with no clearly defined boundaries.  The collocation is not scientifically wighted, it is just the approximate collocation I would give to them. Comments?</img></img>]]></content:encoded>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I'm on the hunt for projects/tools/toolsets/good designs that are involved with the digital replication of texts, creating a range of ways to search, interact with, browse and investigate any text. </p>
<p>I am based at the university of durham, and what we hope this will enable us to identify are new forms of digital curating and scholarly Ôgood practiceÕ.  Our aim is to be able to outline the important underlying principles for anyone interested in discovering and editing versions of physical texts as a digital entity.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any technologies that we should incorporate into our research?... Or other similar projects / interesting people we should contact?... As part of a larger research we'd like to interview anyone involved with this kind of work - as a Curator, designer etc. </p>
<p>Thanks terribly in advance.

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[This post originally appeared at <a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2013/08/quantifying-american-tract-society.html">Religion in American History</a>.]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.americanantiquarian.org/">American Antiquarian Society</a> was generous enough to offer me a fellowship this summer, so I took a month to research in the <a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2013/06/know-your-archives-american-antiquarian.html">AASÕs wonderful collections</a>. A fair bit of my time was spent reading through the nearly complete print run of American Tract Society pamphlets from the early to mid-nineteenth century. I wanted to answer a question: did the ATS pamphlets include Òthe sinnerÕs prayer,Ó a common feature of twentieth century evangelical tracts? If it did, when did the genre develop? I think I have an answer to that question: yes, the ATS did contribute to the development of the genre of the sinnerÕs prayer. More on what I found another time, both here on the blog and in chapter two of the dissertation.</p>
<p>Answering that question required a sense of how the ATS tracts were distributed over time, but reading each pamphlets was a poor way to get that sense. Down in the weeds of the pamphletsÑmost of which sounded alikeÑit was hard to see how the pamphlets were distributed over time. And whatever patterns I could discern were likely to be unreliable: I was, after all, looking for a particular pattern and was thus at risk of committing a classic historiansÕ fallacy. What I needed was an external way of looking at the texts to supplement my close reading.</p>
<p>There was a second problem: itÕs really hard to date the ATS tracts. While most of them print a place of publication and a series number, none of them include a date. The date was left off because the tracts were frequently reprinted, sometimes in millions of impressions. For example a popular tract, Legh RichmondÕs <em>The African Servant</em>, was printed in multiple editions ranging at least from 1816 to 1846, though all bear the series number 60. But S. J. Wolfe of the Antiquarian Society figured out <a href="http://americanantiquarian.org/ATS.htm">how to date</a> the tracts based on the changing addresses of the ATS. Where I brought a knowledge of theology and religious history to my reading of the ATS tract, and even a general knowledge of the history, economics, and methods of the American Tract Society drawn from other historiansÕ work, I had no knowledge of the printing history of the ATS pamphlets. The catalogers at the Antiquarian Society, on the other hand, knew a lot of hard, cold facts about when the pamphlets were published, and who the anonymous authors were. Just as important, they knew when the facts were actually soft and fuzzy, and they had taken pains to represent the ambiguities of the data in the catalog.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem of dating the tracts was also the solution to the problem of getting an overview of the tracts. Because the Antiquarian SocietyÕs catalog lets users export bibliographic information in a variety of formats, I set out to visualize the ATS printing history using the catalog data. Other scholars have are also using library data to visualize printing: Jim Egan and Jean Bauer have a much more <a href="http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/mapping-genres/">ambitious project</a> using collections from the American Antiquarian Society, the John Carter Brown Library, and the John Hay Library.</p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>I made a series of visualizations about various questions using Ruby and R. IÕll gloss over the code here, but the code and the cleaned-up data is <a href="https://github.com/lmullen/ATS-bibliography">available on GitHub</a>. HereÕs how I did it:</p>

<p>I exported the records for all the relevant items from the AAS catalog. In this case I searched for the records by call number, but for other questions one could search by subject heading, by publisher, and so on. I exported to MARC, since it offered the fullest data, and since the Ruby library for MARC was better than for other formats.</p>
<p>I used a <a href="https://github.com/lmullen/ATS-bibliography/blob/master/munge.rb">Ruby script</a> to munge the MARC records into usable <a href="https://github.com/lmullen/ATS-bibliography/tree/master/data-clean">CSV files</a>.</p>
<p>I used an <a href="https://github.com/lmullen/ATS-bibliography/blob/master/analysis.R">R script</a> to analyze the data.</p>

<p>The kind of analysis that IÕm writing about here is not an argument itself, but a step along the way to an argument. Nor do I mean to imply that there is some kind of ÒscientificÓ value in this analysis. Take this for what it is: a behind-the-scenes musing about methodology.</p>
<h3 id="dates">Dates</h3>
<p>One of my questions was when the ATS published its tracts. This is a histogram of the tracts by date.</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/downloads/post/ats-pub-date.png"></p>
<p>The American Tract Society was founded in 1825 from the merger of the New-York Religious Tract Society and the Boston-based American Tract Society (formerly, the New England Religious Tract Society). The chart shows that the ATS quickly ramped up the publication of tracts in its first five years. Many of these early pamphlets were reprints from British tract societies, such as the Religious Tract Society of London founded in 1799. As was the case with most evangelical institutions from this period, the British had a head start, and evangelicalism was an Anglophone movement with debts to German, French, and Swiss Protestants. The ATS republished works from proven British authors, such as Legh Richmond and Hannah More. After the early series of tracts, beginning in the 1830s, the ATS published more of its own original tracts.</p>
<p>The above chart shows the earliest possible date that a given tract was published. But the ATS republished these tracts in many editions throughout the nineteenth century. The point is that the ATS publications tended to be first published in the decade between 1825 and 1835Ñexactly the period when Charles Finney was most active in New York. But unlike Finney, these tracts kept getting the message out for the entirety of the nineteenth century. (The ATS is <a href="http://www.crossway.org/group/ats">still publishing</a> today.) And though much of FinneyÕs powerful presentation came from being in his presence, and sitting on his anxious bench, the ATS tracts were carried across the country by colporteurs to places like the pine barrens of New Jersey which the government could barely reach.</p>
<h3 id="subjects">Subjects</h3>
<p>A second, obvious, question is, what were these tracts about? Though I had a pretty good sense of the proportions of the various topics, counting the subject headings is a useful correction to possibly haphazard impressions. The ATS catalog entries have 186 distinct subject headings. The distribution of all the subject headings is the familiar Òlong tail.Ó Keep in mind, though, that each tract can have more than one subject heading, so <a href="http://catalog.mwa.org/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=229772">a tract</a> might be about both one of the most obscure topics (ÒWineÑpoetryÓ) and one of the most common topics (ÒTemperanceÓ).</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/downloads/post/ats-all-subjects.png"></p>
<p>The chart is more useful if we limit it to only the twenty most frequently used subject headings.</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/downloads/post/ats-subjects.png"></p>
<p>These headings fall into several groups:</p>

<p>Tracts which promote conversion: headings like salvation, conversion, repentance, future punishment, and converts certainly fit into this group.</p>
<p>Tracts about family life and the education of children. These tracts are also about how to prepare children for conversion.</p>
<p>The rest of subject headings, which considered together makes the biggest grouping, are instructions in doctrine and the means of grace. The ATS seems to have thought of its mission as being to edify Christians as much as to evangelize unbelievers.</p>

<p>There is one topic which I found to be ubiquitous in reading the tracts, but which is barely noticeable in the subject headings, namely, warnings against infidelity, atheism, and liberal religion. Tracts with the subject heading Òfuture punishmentÓ were mostly written against Universalists. Other tracts were written against Unitarians. But even though only a few tracts are explicitly about Deists or atheists, they are mentioned or appear as characters in, I would guess, two out of three tracts. Curiously, Catholics are barely mentioned except in a very few ÒpatrioticÓ tracts. Historians have long recognized the nineteenth century as the century of Protestant anti-Catholicism, and of course it was. But for the ATS the real bogeyman was not Catholicism but infidelity. On the importance of atheism, skepticism, and free thought for shaping American religion, see my recent <a href="http://usreligion.blogspot.com/2013/06/where-are-histories-of-american.html">historiographic essay</a> and the soon-to-be last chapter of my dissertation.</p>
<h3 id="length">Length</h3>
<p>Anyone who is familiar with the contemporary evangelical tracts would be surprised at long the ATS tracts are. Where a contemporary tract might be six or eight very small pages with several illustrations, the ATS tracts average sixteen pages of closely printed type and were commonly thirty-two pages long. Besides the main tract that comprised the body, the tracts usually had a paper wrapper which had supplementary materials or another tract in its own right. Bill BrightÕs well-known tract from the 1960s, <em>Do You Know the Four Spiritual Laws</em>, could fit on the wrapper of one of these hefty ATS tracts.</p>
<p>Since I am making an argument about how the normative experience of conversion became simplified, I wondered whether the tracts got shorter over time. They did not.</p>
<p><img class="center" src="/downloads/post/ats-length.png"></p>
<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>
<p>The most useful analysis was figuring out who wrote these tracts. Not only were the authors frequently British or occasionally Swiss or German, the authors were frequently from the eighteenth or even the seventeenth centuries. In this histogram IÕve charted the number of tracts by the death date of their authors. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></p>
<p><img class="center" src="/downloads/post/ats-authors.png"></p>
<p>We can get a sense of who wrote the ATS tracts by looking at most frequently published authors. <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></p>

<p>The chart and the table show that most of the authors lived in the nineteenth century contemporaneous with the ATS. This chart does not include anonymous tracts, most of which were from the nineteenth century. Yet the ATS also reprinted works from Puritan divines or English Nonconformists such as John Flavel, John Owen, and Richard Baxter, and also revivalists and evangelicals like theologian Jonathan Edwards, hymn writer Isaac Watts, and most frequently the Nonconformist pastor Phillipp Doddridge.</p>
<p>In excerpting and re-framing these works of earlier generations, the ATS was remaking an old tradition into a new tradition. The history of the ATS publications is thus a story of long continuity in an evangelical tradition of heart religion and vital piety, centered on conversion, being gradually remadeÑsometimes intentionally but often through subtle shifts in the meanings of words and drifting in the substance of doctrine or practiceÑinto a new forms of conversion.</p>
<p>HereÕs to my unsung collaborators: the diligent catalogers at the American Antiquarian Society, some of whom I had the privilege of meeting.</p>



<p>I used the death date since there is necessarily quite a few years between oneÕs birth and the time one is publishing.<a href="#fnref1">?</a></p>
<p>The prominence of Isaac Watts is a bit misleading, because he is listed as an author on tracts that contain his hymns, though he might not always be the primary author. But on the other hand, the frequency with which his hymns appear, probably understated in the catalog, is itself a sign of influence.<a href="#fnref2">?</a></p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VaFxgHJLHxI/UfoqW0ZKewI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/WTpdmL80c3E/s1600/il_fullxfull.301496479.jpg" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VaFxgHJLHxI/UfoqW0ZKewI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/WTpdmL80c3E/s320/il_fullxfull.301496479.jpg" width="320" /></a>"For sale: Mixing bowl set designed to please a cook".That opening sentence contains 10 words, or "tokens" as linguists often call them. Yet either in its spoken or written form, it really only transmits 4 ideas, or what I imagine Marc Alexander would call "<a href="http://youtu.be/3iGqwZhGCxU" target="_blank">metaphors</a>", which are concepts that go beyond the words but that express meaning and understanding. They allow us to think in chunks.What?: For saleWhat's for sale?: a mixing bowl setWhat's it like?: designed to pleasePlease whom?: a cook The same sentence represents an attempt to conjure a very measured set of thoughts in another person. I can't take <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/cig/grammar-style/misplaced-modifiers-lost-found.html" target="_blank">credit</a> for the sentence, but when the author wrote it down, they hoped that you, dear reader, would understand those 4 ideas in the same way as all the other readers, and as they themselves understood them. It's their attempt to control your mind temporarily by drawing upon your understanding and memories associated with those 4 ideas. We may not get all the details exactly the same. Your mixing bowl set may be blue. Mine is seafoam and has spout on each bowl to make it easier to pour your batter into the baking tin. So we likely havn't had exactly the same understanding of the sentence, but our understandings are almost certainly within the limits of what's acceptable to the author.If we add 2 more ideas to the end of the sentence we end up with a failed conjuration:"For sale: Mixing bowl set designed to please a cook with a round bottom for efficient beating".Because of the misplaced modifier, there are now two ways to understand these ideas. Does the bowl have a round bottom for efficient beating, or should the cook who will enjoy the bowl be so proportioned?Visualizations can offer the same ambiguity.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--XXORbNTSjE/UfoQ49dZc2I/AAAAAAAAAng/2ddAU2pDWvs/s1600/707px-Kaninchen_und_Ente.png" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="271" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--XXORbNTSjE/UfoQ49dZc2I/AAAAAAAAAng/2ddAU2pDWvs/s320/707px-Kaninchen_und_Ente.png" width="320" /></a>Is this an image of a rabbit, or a duck?In this case, it's both, and it's that very ambiguity that the artist intended us to understand. Not all visualizations are intended to teach us something specific, or to so carefully conjure a series of ideas in our minds. That's wholly too modernist for some. Visualizations can be exploratory, used by researchers to come to a different understanding of their data by slicing it in lots of ways until they see something interesting. Or, as I demonstrated in an earlier post, can be a quick way to get a <a href="http://adamcrymble.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/distant-reading-by-using-written-index.html" target="_blank">distant look at a large amount of data by reducing it to something easier to digest</a>. In that sense graphing can aid the discovery process of research even before the conclusions are ready to be shared with the world.But when it comes to visualizations for academic publication, unintentional ambiguity is something we must strive to avoid. If done well, there should only be one proper way of interpreting the  visualization. It's our job to create something that can conjure specific thoughts in the reader's head  based on the graph's shape, colour, size, orientation, etc. And it should go without saying that those conjured thoughts should be grounded in rigorous research.As academics we spend so much time and care on our prose, and even our footnotes. Usually (we hope) that prose comes out lucid and if we're lucky, is enjoyable to read. One of the ways we ensure that is through peer review. The editors help us find people who are willing to take the time to read what we've written and provide constructive feedback upon it.Yet few of us feel we have the aptitude to offer similar feedback on visualizations. We're not visual artists and so we can be forgiven <a href="http://eagereyes.org/basics/rainbow-color-map" target="_blank">for using colour in confusing ways</a>, or for thinking <a href="http://www.datavis.ca/gallery/evil-pies.php" target="_blank">a pie chart with 100 categories</a> is a good way to express an idea. As I mentioned previously, I'm quite confident that in the present climate, unique looking or impressive visualizations will slip through peer review unchecked, lest the reviewer's lack of expertise in visualization be exposed by making a comment to the effect of "<a href="http://adamcrymble.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/shock-and-awe-graphs-in-digital.html" target="_blank">I don't under stand this graph</a>".Now, far be it from me to suggest we only use column graphs or line graphs, or that we do X, but not Y. I think it's fantastic that so many people out there are pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve via visualization. The folks at the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog" target="_blank">Guardian Data Blog</a> do great work on bringing data to life, and are a wonderful place for anyone seeking inspiration. Instead, what I would suggest is that as creators of academic visualizations, we make sure our graphs are reviewed, even if our reviewers cannot or will not do so in the traditional peer review process.The way I'd propose we do that is to show our friends and colleagues what we've made as often as we can, including during the drafting process. But it's not just about showing them. We have to ask the right questions. Let's use the graph below as a (relatively poor) example of a visualization that we might like to get feedback on. Please note that this is not a graph showing real data about the cost of grain in the 19th century. It's just an example.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-elj9i5W2H9o/UfoddHrwbxI/AAAAAAAAAnw/IQArauUSWSk/s1600/sampleGraph.png" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-elj9i5W2H9o/UfoddHrwbxI/AAAAAAAAAnw/IQArauUSWSk/s320/sampleGraph.png" width="315" /></a>Most of us likely want to ask "Do you like my graph?" or "What do you think of this?"A more productive starting point is probably: Can you explain this graph to me? You aren't going to be there when your reader or viewer is interpreting your graph. The best way to find out what set of ideas are going to form in their mind is to ask them to explain their thought process out loud.In this case, I had intended to show the seasonal difference in the price of grain in London and Edinburgh over a 20 year period. You may not have picked up on that, which means I need to fix something.Don't be affraid to ask explicitly: Is there any element of this graph that you do not inherently understand? Make sure they can explain the labels on both axes (if relevant). If they don't know where you're getting those values from you may need to rethink your axis labels. You'd be forgiven for asking what the numbers on the Y-axis represent in the example. I didn't label it, so how could you know?When you start experimenting with your visualizations, you're bound to come up with ideas you think are clear, but that just don't translate into ideas that your reader can interpret. Looking at the sample graph, I wouldn't fault you for asking what the top and bottom line of the curves represent. They're supposed to be two line graphs: one representing Edinburgh prices, and one representing London. I've shaded in the space between the lines to emphasize the size of the gap. If this is in fact two lines, then which one is Edinburgh? Which one is London? And when they overlap, how  do I know which bit corresponds to which line? Do they cross, or merely  meet and diverge again? I havn't made the fact that this is a line graph obvious because the lines aren't distinguishable from the shape formed by the colours. Speaking of colour, you'll want to make sure you havn't come up with a palette that is going to make interpreting your graph difficult for someone with colour blindness. There are many different forms of colour-blindness, so it pays to run a test on your graph. You can do this online by using a "<a href="http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/" target="_blank">Colour Blindness Simulator</a>" on your finished image.Sticking with the negatives, ask your tester which element of the graph they like the least. For the sample graph, they may say they don't like the colours, or the font, or the legend. Personally, I think using --------&gt; to represent arrows looks lazy. Everyone will have their own opinions on what's worst about your work. If you know what turns people off you can make visualizations that people like. And if they like the visualization, readers are more likely to engage with its message. With this in mind, go ahead and ask if they <i>like </i>your graph. Or if there are any elements of the graph that they particularly fancy. Just as with your prose, it may take a few iterations and a number of different opinions from colleagues before a graph says to others what you think it says in your own mind. Just because you submitted a graph with your article and the peer-reviewers didn't comment on it doesn't mean you've done a good job of clearly expressing your ideas visually.And one last question to ask, just to make sure your readers get the right message and aren't distracted: does the shape of the graph make it look like anything unrelated?<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VVSF77EXqi0/UfojKvymevI/AAAAAAAAAoA/WEoS1FtE82Y/s1600/graph-fail-performance-evaluation-penis-jizz.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" height="207" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VVSF77EXqi0/UfojKvymevI/AAAAAAAAAoA/WEoS1FtE82Y/s320/graph-fail-performance-evaluation-penis-jizz.jpg" width="320" /></a>Graphs and visualizations have tremendous potential for expressing ideas in academic research, but it's not a skill we're typically taught in school. Most of us learn on the job, or emulate graphs we saw elsewhere that we found effective. Taking the time to ensure the graphs you create transmit the right ideas to your reader is good scholarship. Knowing the right questions to ask makes it that much easier to reach that result.Questions to ask about a visualization:Can you explain this graph to me?Are there any elements you do not inherently understand?Can you explain what each axis shows (if applicable)Will people with colour blindness be able to differentiate your colour palette? (check online)What do you like least about the graph?Do you like the graph / a particular element of the graph?Does the shape of the graph make it look like anything distracting?<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ThoughtsOnPublicHistoryByAdamCrymble/~4/iDL1NUuKFfk" height="1" width="1" /></img></img></img></img></img>]]></content:encoded>

But with SnappyCam 3.0, you can shoot 20 full-resolution photos per second thanks to a breakthrough in discrete cosine transform JPG science by its inventor. Twenty frames per second is fast enough to capture shot-by-shot animations or every gruesome detail of an extreme sports crash.

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://stanislausriver.org/items/show/23"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-17145" src="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/scotty1-343x500.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="500" /></a>As a commercial river guide, if you demonstrate any real aptitude at one point or another you will be assigned to be Trip Leader. Just like it sounds, that&#8217;s where the buck stops, and a lot of responsibility comes with it.</p>
<p>Your first and foremost responsibility is for theÊ<strong>safety</strong>Êof everyone on the trip. You are of course focused mainly on the passengers, as they mostly have no idea what they have signed up for. You can expect that the guides do, but they bear watching too. You can just take my word on that.</p>
<p>Once safety has been assured as well as one can in the wild, the next focus of your attention is onÊ<strong>fun</strong>. Thankfully, fun is pretty hard to deny on just about any river trip. And I&#8217;ve been on a river trip when it hasÊ<em>snowed</em>, and IÊ<em>still</em>Êhad an awesome time.</p>
<p>If you do things right, thenÊ<strong>learning</strong>Êis a big part of any river trip &#8212; and it often comes disguised as fun. For most people, there is so much to be learned on a river trip. There may be new trees and plants and wildlife that can be pointed out and named. The local geology is likely not something visitors are knowledgeable about. Even the river itself, and what makes currents, eddies, waves and holes.</p>
<p>For me leading trips came quickly in my career as a guide. First I led trips on the Stanislaus and American rivers in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in California. Then, within a little over a year, I was the trip leader of an 18-day Grand Canyon private (not with a commercial company) trip. This was because I was the most experienced guide on the trip, and had even been down the Colorado through the Grand Canyon the year before &#8212; my inaugural year of becoming a commercial guide &#8212; on aÊ<em>30-day</em>Êtrip (these are no longer permitted). You might say I learned quickly what it meant to be a trip leader in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Without the solid background of training with a commercial river company, I don&#8217;t know what I would have done. But as it was, that provided the essential foundation from which I could build the necessary knowledge to run a Grand Canyon trip safely. Also, I had my one previous trip in &#8220;The Canyon&#8221; from which to draw. This turned out to be essential, as that was when I learned about the &#8220;tides&#8221; of the Colorado River.</p>
<p>The Colorado River exits the bottom of Glen Canyon Dam just upstream from where you put-in the boats to run the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Since the flow of the river is completely controlled by the dam, they release enough water for recreational purposes during the day and then dial the flow way back at night. On the river this means you could have a vertical displacement change in the river of something likeÊ<a href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?site_no=09402500"><em>2-4 vertical feet</em>Ê</a>Êdepending on a variety of factors. The practical effect of this is if you tie your boat up to shore at night, it might be beached 30 feet away from the river in the morning. If you have ever had to drag a raft this far you will know what a drag (sorry!) this can be.</p>
<p>So part of a trip leader&#8217;s responsibility on The Canyon was to tie the boats properly &#8212; which often meant with plenty of slack in the line and a secondary line through the stern of every boat. ÊAnd then, the last thing you did before falling into bed was to check on the boats. If any were beginning to beach, you pushed them out into the water. You also checked to make sure the lines were good. Only then could you rest. And if you were drunk, it just meant you had to be really careful, but you still had to do it.</p>
<p>The parallel with libraries is probably obvious. If you&#8217;ve ever had a position with &#8220;where the buck stops&#8221; responsibility, you never forget what that means. And whether you always hold a position like that or not, you can&#8217;t unlearn it. Whether it is likely your responsibility or not, you won&#8217;t be able to help yourself. You will be out there at night, with the water lapping on shore, checking the boats with a flashlight. Because you know it needs to be done and you know you&#8217;re good for it.</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two hours ago, I had to ask someone what day it was. But now that it&#8217;s almost midnight, I&#8217;m finding myself drawn once again to the blank page of the blog post. Or rather, I appear to be treating the idea of blogging every day of <a href="http://oneweekonetool.org">One Week | One Tool</a>Êas some sort of dare with myself. What follows is an account that is perhaps more trees than forest; if you want to get to the larger arboretum of what I&#8217;ve learned today, skip to the end.</p>
<p>As I promised at the end of yesterday&#8217;s post, today found the OWOT team putting their heads down and getting earnestly to work on a lot of the different parts of the project. And at this point, it&#8217;s hard to believe that we didn&#8217;t know what we were building 36 hours ago. The dev / design team continued forging ahead on the path that they had identified for themselves yesterday, working pretty solidly from the morning until the end of the day when they showed the whole team a working demo to thunderous applause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/briancroxall/9413851558/"><img title="IMG_0262.JPG" alt="Mia prepping us for the demo" src="http://www.briancroxall.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_0262.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The Outreach team decided to start producing text: press release materials, lists of people that we will be peppering with the announcement come Friday. Perhaps even more importantÑand much more difficultÑthey worked to come up with the name for our tool. But waitÉI&#8217;m not necessarily on either of those teams. So what did I do all day?</p>
<p>Largely, my day of project management has consisted in moving back and forth between teams, working on different tasks. The Outreach team yesterday came up with a couple of user scenarios to help us all make better sense of how the tool would be used. I volunteered to translate the scenarios and the different conversations that I had heard in conversations with the dev/design team. After managingÊ<a href="http://disc.library.emory.edu/networkingbelfast/project-blog/">Networking Belfast</a>, <a href="http://disc.library.emory.edu/viewsofrome/">Views of Rome</a>, and other <a href="http://web.library.emory.edu/disc/projects">DiSC projects</a>, I&#8217;ve found that I kind of enjoy writing user stories, making sure that I&#8217;m making something that is testable as well as covering all of the aspects of the tool development that we&#8217;re going to need to have to produce the experience that all of the team has imagined. <a href="http://openobjects.blogspot.com/">Mia</a>,Êthe lead of dev/design team and I then sat down and talked through the different stories, prioritizing and ruling some of them as likely out of scope.</p>
<p>After this, Meghan and I sat down to talk with <a href="http://foundhistory.org">Tom Scheinfeldt</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/partick_mj">Patrick Murray-John</a>, and <a href="http://quintessenceofham.org/">Sean Takats</a>Êabout software licenses. CHNM tends to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">Affero General Public License (AGPL)</a>. At Emory we&#8217;ve tended towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache</a>, so it was good to learn about other options that exist. Meghan and I got to work sussing out the different software libraries that are being used by our development team. I also took on a task from Mia to begin stubs for the documentation we&#8217;ll need to add toÊ<a href="https://github.com/404">our GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Somewhere in here, we got some amazing Bolivian salteas for lunch.</p>
<p><img title="IMG_0257.jpg" alt="A saltea" src="http://www.briancroxall.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_02571.jpg" width="225" height="300" border="0" /></p>
<p>&#8230;although come to think of it, Sean brought in the food, so we clearly couldn&#8217;t talk about licenses until after lunch. Hmm. Let&#8217;s move on, shall we?</p>
<p>Before lunch the Outreach team had provided an overview of both the names that they were considering for the tool as well as metaphors that they were trying to use to understand the whole experience and that were guiding selection of the name. After lunch, they turned their attention to trying to finish off one of the press releases. They had decided that in addition to the press release for the product launch that OWOT&#8217;s emphasis on <strong>process over product</strong>Êmight be of interest to certain media outlets. In his role as head of Outreach,Ê<a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/">Jack Dougherty</a>Êhad drafted this text, and that team and Meghan and I workshopped it down to hone the message. Simultaneously, we were talking about what press outlets might be interested in this particular angle. It turns out that thanks to my work with ProfHacker I knew a lot of the people thatÊ<a href="http://raypalin.info/blog/">Ray Palin</a>Êhad identified as worth reaching out to. After finalizing the press release and getting it posted in <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/news/another-week-another-tool/">one version to the CHNM website</a>, I started pounding out emails, both formal and informal. There may have been some curse words thrown when my I couldn&#8217;t connect to my email server and when my keyboard suddenly refused to type. But eventually they got moving.</p>
<p>While we were working on all of this, the Outreach team had returned to working on names. Although the team had spent a lot of time so far,Ê<a href="http://amrys.wordpress.com/">Amrys Williams</a>Êwas up for the challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/briancroxall/9413850194/"><img title="IMG_0259.jpg" alt="An exasperated Amrys" src="http://www.briancroxall.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_0259.jpg" width="400" height="533" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>More metaphors, more stories, and more throwing hippos at walls to see if they would stick. And you know what, we finally got it. It took 121 name ideasÑincluding, somehow, &#8220;Croxalizer&#8221; [sic]Ñbut we&#8217;ve got a name! We bought some domains, we registered some email addresses and got a Twitter account. We&#8217;re getting ready. That said, while the name was being centered on was the moment of my maximal email frustration. So the moment didn&#8217;t feel as victorious as I would have liked.</p>
<p>We then broke for dinner at a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sisters-thai-fairfax">great Thai place</a> where we found some amazing objects that are far more connected to our tool than we could have ever guessed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teddy-Bear-Book-Peter-Bull/dp/0875882773"><img title="IMG_0271.jpg" alt="Mia and *The Teddy Bear Book*" src="http://www.briancroxall.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_0271.jpg" width="400" height="533" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We then repaired to the Mason Inn, where we broke into teams and planned our schedules for tomorrow. Meghan and I acted as go-betweens on both teams, seeing who they would need from the others in order to get their work done in a timely fashion. I wrapped up the evening sitting down with Mia and half of her team, looking again at the user stories to see what was done and what was now out of scope, as well as reviewing other lists of still to be accomplished tasks. In there, I did what I could to take tasks off of Mia&#8217;s plate, to make sure everyone had water and power, and to pingÊ<a href="http://twitter.com/suttonkoeser">Rebecca Sutton Koeser</a> every 15 minutes about going to bed rather than continuing to code.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s a lot of detail about what I&#8217;ve done today. What does it all add up to? First, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that a big part of tool development ends up being about stories. Coming up with a name requires thinking about the story that that name ties into, about the experience as a whole. The press release is also about a story. Jack did a great job coming up with a rhetorical angle for pitching the process as something that is just as interesting to report on as the final product. And of course there were those user stories. These are different from the other stories and are exercises in precise descriptive prose. In some ways, I think I am drawn to these activities given my training in literature. I like thinking about what words can do and how they convey meaning, and then I like trying to pin those words down in such a way so that my meaning is clear to those with whom I&#8217;m communicating.</p>
<p>I also think that building a tool depends in some parts on gophers. In our role of project managers, ÊMeghan and I are doing what we can to take care of the needs of the different teams. One of those needs is of course managing the to-do list. But it also meant hunting down a new computer for a team member or doing that aforementioned &#8220;it&#8217;s bedtime&#8221; pinging. What this experience is helping me realize is how deeply satisfying I find it to be helpful to other people in these ways. It&#8217;s more than simply feeling useful (when I&#8217;m not a coder and when I&#8217;m <em>clearly</em>Ênot the most experience project manager when compare to others on the team); it&#8217;s about building a team through considerate interaction. <strong>Making a project, it turns out, is just as much about building a team as it is about anything else.Ê</strong></p>
<p>That might not be a profound insight; it is, after all, 1:10 am as I finish drafting this. But it&#8217;s a new one to me, and I will say that it alone makes this whole experience worth it. We&#8217;ve got a lot more work to do tomorrow. See you in 24.</p>
<p>(By now I&#8217;m guessing, dear reader, that you&#8217;re canny enough to know not to click on that link above to our GitHub repo. Still, I couldn&#8217;t resist.)</p>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crikey. Day three.&nbsp;Where do I start?

<a href="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5495/9414084078_639b99aa3e_t.jpg" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5495/9414084078_639b99aa3e_t.jpg" /></a>We've made great progress on our mysterious tool. And it has a name! Some cool design motifs are flowing from that, which in turn means we can really push the user experience design issues over the next day and a half (though we've already been making lots of design decisions on the hoof so we can keep dev moving). The Outreach team have also been doing some great communications work, including a <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/news/another-week-another-tool/">Press Release</a>&nbsp;and have lots more in the pipeline. The Dev/Design team did a demo of our work for the Outreach team before dinner - it's amazing how far we've come since lunchtime yesterday. &nbsp;We still need to do a full deployment (server issues, blah blah), and I'll feel a lot better when we've got that process working and then running smoothly, so that we can keep deploying as we finish major features up to a few hours before launch rather than doing it at the end in a mad panic. 

<a href="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2856/9411320327_ef80331998_t.jpg" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2856/9411320327_ef80331998_t.jpg" /></a>There's lots to tackle on many different fronts, and it may still end up in a mad rush at the end, but right now, the&nbsp;Dev/Design&nbsp;team is humming along. I've been so impressed with the way people have coped with some pretty intense requirements for working with unfamiliar languages or frameworks, and with high levels of uncertainty in a chaotic environment. &nbsp;I'm trying to keep track of things in Github (with Meghan and Brian as brilliant 'got my back' PMs) and keep the key current tasks on a whiteboard so that people know exactly what they need to be getting done at any time. Now that the Outreach team have worked through the key descriptive texts, name and tagline we'll need to coordinate content production - particularly documentation, microcopy to guide people through the process - really closely, which will probably get tricky as time is short and our tasks are many, but given the people gathered together for OWOT, I have faith that we'll make it work.

<a href="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5328/9411318739_656ef991a6_m.jpg" style="clear: left;float: left;margin-bottom: 1em;margin-right: 1em"><img border="0" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5328/9411318739_656ef991a6_m.jpg" /></a>
Things I have learnt today: despite two years working on a PhD in digital humanities/digital history, I still have a brain full of technical stuff - it's a relief to realise it hasn't atrophied through lack of use. I've also realised how much the work I've done designing workshops and teaching since starting my PhD have fed into how I work with teams, though it's hard right now to quantify exactly *how*. Finally, it's re-affirmed just how much I like making things - but also that it's important to make those things in the company of people who are scholarly (or at least thoughtful) about subjects beyond tech and inter-disciplinary, and ideally to make things that engage the public as well as researchers. As the end of my PhD approaches, it's been really useful to step back into this world for a week, and I'll definitely draw on it when figuring out what to do after the PhD. If someone could just start a CHNM in the UK, I'd be very happy.

I still can't tell you what we're making, but I *can* tell you that one of these photos in this post contains a clue (and they all definitely have nothing to do with mild lightheadedness at the end of a long day).<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OpenObjects/atom/~4/fInW1cO9IRA" height="1" width="1" /></img></img></img></img>]]></content:encoded>

I was fascinated by the ease with which I could register, interact, and connect with leading figures in educational technology. As soon as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/courosa">Alec Couros</a>&rsquo;s webinar was over, I said to myself: I want to figure out how to design and create MOOCs for K-12 learning environments. The concept that learners of all ages could learn together based on individual passions rather than through set institutional norms appealed me. It seemed obvious that using social media and building networks was the way to engage learners. Networked learning ignited a fire inside of me to try to change a system. <img class="imageStyle" alt="blogEntryTopper" src="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/Journal/files/explode.jpg" width="640" height="480" />]]></content:encoded>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The first version of this cheat sheet was prepared for a talk given at the NEH, ODH Project Directors&#8217; meeting (September 2012). I revised it in its current form for the Another Week | Another Tool ODH Summer Institute, July 2013, and is available also as a Google Doc: <a href="http://bit.ly/OWOTProjectOutreach">http://bit.ly/OWOTProjectOutreach</a> .</em></p>
<h2>Outreach:</h2>

is intentional;
is integral to a tools/projectÕs success. Outreach team must be equal stakeholders in the building process;
is not only about publicity, the job includes testing and making the tool accessible to targeted audiences;
is user advocacy.

<h2>Four components of a good outreach strategy:
Plan | People | Presence | Press </h2>
<h2>Plan</h2>

Outreach is intentional, it requires a plan (most grant programs require you have one, too):
Articulate primary audiences, secondary audiences
Create user scenarios.
Learn about those audiences: where do they go for information, how can you best reach them.
How can you best teach them about the tool later?
Think about online and analog ways to reach people.
Plan to extend outreach duties well beyond the official launch of the prototype/tool/software: workshops, demos, support.

<h2>People</h2>

Outreach must be someone&#8217;s job.
Outreach folks must be equal stakeholders in the building process, and are identified as the project begins. This job is not over even after a grant ends&#8230;unfortunately.
Outreach must be involved in testing, and in UX/UI advocating for intended users during development.
Test like you know nothing about the project.

<h2>Presence</h2>

Establish and maintain a stable, digital presence for the project immediately.

Name the Tool&#8211;do some research on alternative meanings for names (check Urban Dictionary).
Buy domains&#8230;try to scoop up as many as you can once youÕre committed to a name.
Grab the twitter handle.
Design a logo and start using it.
Build a project website, and only launch the site when you have content and something to say. Pages must contain words and sentences! Do not expound about the PIs CV. Focus on what it is, what it does, what it can do, and who on TEAM is building, creating, testing.
Start a blog for regular project updates, process posts, celebrations



Teach others how to use the tool with online Documentation. User guides help teach new users how this works (different formats WP pages, a Wiki, GitHub pages).


Format and location of this documentation depends heavily on the users and the software.
You might have multiple places to find help, depending on what user needs:
<a href="http://omeka.org/codex/Main_Page">Omeka End User Documentation</a> | <a href="http://omeka.readthedocs.org/en/stable-2.0/">Omeka Developer Codex</a> | <a href="http://info.omeka.net/">Omeka.net Users</a> | <a href="http://anthologize.org/learn/user-guide/">Anthologize User Guide</a> | <a href="http://scripto.org/documentation/">Scripto UserÕs Guide</a>


Give users a place to ask questions and give feedback
Appropriateness depends on users, scope of possible questions, level of technical knowledge required:
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omeka-dev">Omeka devsÕ</a> (Google Group) | <a href="http://omeka.org/forums">End User Forums</a> (BBPress) | <a href="http://info.omeka.net/contact">Contact form</a> for Net | <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anthologize-users">Anthologize End Users</a> (Google Group) | <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anthologize-dev">Anthologize Devs</a> (Google Group)
Together with project managers and developers set goals and be ready to release/launch on those dates.
Perhaps you want to debut at a big conference or another significant event. Hard deadlines are good.

<h2>Press</h2>

Before a release, prepare your publicity.
Give press previews to new tool by finding a writer, podcaster who might speak to your intended audiences.
Blog progress and launch news, tweet it, get others to retweet.
Incorporate electronic, print, social media, in-person. You may have institutional public affairs officers who can help.
Prepare analog stuff: Showcase your logo, your URL and let folks show their support for your project w/a sticker, bookmark, pen, mug.
Bookmarks can be cheap (500, 4-color, 1-color on backside, under $100 w/shipping).

<p>FOLLOW-THROUGH:</p>

Answer emails, phone calls.
Check forums regularly.
Respond to questions.
Incorporate user feedback into the tool.
Present at conferences.
Give a workshop.
Encourage others to use it and teach others.
Leave a SWAG trail when you travel.

<p>So far, I can say the &#8220;Chorus&#8221; character is overused, too frequently walking onstage and delivering lines of exposition that ought instead be woven into the expanded dialogue between the characters. </p>
<p>An Elizabethan drama was a medium for the spoken word, and having a narrator walk on to TELL the audience about the scene is a poor substitute for having a character weave details from the environment into a complex verbal expression of emotion.</p></img>]]></content:encoded>

							<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center"><a title="Link to MMWC #1 on Issuu" href="http://issuu.com/mmwc/docs/mmwc1_b5093b9091511b"><img class="wp-image-2037" alt="mmwc1_Page_1" src="http://jasonbairdjackson.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/mmwc1_page_1-e1375321360132.jpg?w=420&#038;h=545" width="420" height="545" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The <a title="MMWC website" href="http://www.mathers.indiana.edu/" target="_blank">Mathers Museum of World Cultures</a> (MMWC) has a new newsletter. The cover for <em>MMWC</em> #1 is shown above. Clicking on it should take you to the whole issue as it appears on the online publishing platform <a title="Issuu website" href="http://issuu.com/about" target="_blank">Issuu</a>. To add the newsletter to your hoard of PDFs, you can <a title="PDF link for MMWC #1 from the MMWC website" href="www.mathers.indiana.edu/mmwc1.pdf" target="_blank">download it from the MMWC website</a>. For the long haul, we will soon add the newsletter to the museum&#8217;s &#8220;community&#8221; in the <a title="MMWC in IUScholarWorks Repository" href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/15356" target="_blank">IUScholarWorks Repository</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Before talking about the newsletter as infrastructure, I want to thank MMWC Assistant Director Judy Kirk for her great work getting it edited and launched. This is a small summer issue that recaps some recent MMWC developments. A forward-looking fall issue will follow it very soon. While thanking Judy, I want to also thank the whole MMWC community&#8211;staff, volunteers, students, researchers, advisory board members, donors&#8211;for the work that we begin reporting in this first issue of the newsletter.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">One of the museum&#8217;s accomplishments of the first half of 2013 was the establishment of an ambitious strategic plan. One thread running through that plan is work aimed at putting into place a range of kinds of museum &#8220;infrastructure.&#8221; Some of this will be very visible to the museum&#8217;s friends and supporters, other kinds of infrastructure will help the museum do its behind-the-scenes work more effectively. As I can, I will try to tell the story of our infrastructure work here. I have found the public reporting of my colleagues and of peer-institutions extremely helpful and my aim here is to reciprocate in appreciation for what I have learned from them. (For a recent example, consider this <a title="Blog post on the collections teaching lab at Penn" href="http://www.penn.museum/blog/museum/if-you-build-it-they-will-come/" target="_blank">great account of the building of a teaching lab at the Penn Museum</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Our new newsletter represents a beginning, a first start. We know that it will mature and change over time. In software-speak, it will be in <a title="&quot;perpetual beta&quot; in wikipedia english" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_beta" target="_blank">perpetual beta</a>. One aspect of this status, is that the newsletter&#8217;s users will be &#8220;co-developers&#8221; and the newsletter will respond to not only institutional need but also to the needs of its community.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">One element of the environment out of which the new newsletter has arisen is the beginnings of a <a title="IU branding website" href="http://brand.iu.edu/" target="_blank">comprehensive branding effort at Indiana University</a>. As an Indiana University unit, the museum wants to both contribute to the success of the university as a whole and to benefit from the institution&#8217;s overall success. Advancing, and aligning with, the university&#8217;s branding work is part of this. The new newsletter&#8217;s fonts are the university&#8217;s new fonts. Its colors are drawn from the university&#8217;s new palettes. The museum&#8217;s wordmark is our official instance from the university&#8217;s wordmark and signature system. As these things go, our timing was very lucky. When a new enterprise branding system rolls out, there are always plenty of units who have legacy graphics, templates, and content in place. The move to a unified brand system is always painful for such units, both in terms of work and sunk costs. For the museum, our bringing a newsletter into existence just after the release of the new brand system is an incredibly lucky break.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A museum newsletter staple is acknowledging donors (financial, collections, and in-kind). Saying thanks in diverse ways is a crucial part of museum stewardship. Our new newsletter contributes to this work. (Thanks again MMWC donors!). It also includes a link to another new piece of MMWC infrastructure. This is what is called, in IU-speak, our <a title="MMWC &quot;Give Now&quot; Foundation LInk" href="https://apps2.iuf.indiana.edu/og-prd/SelectAccounts.do?method=enter&amp;campus=IUB&amp;school=OTH&amp;department=W.H.%20Mathers%20Museum&amp;campaignCode=BGD1029-13" target="_blank">&#8220;give now&#8221; button</a>. This is a direct link to the Indiana University Foundation, where prospective donors can quickly and easily make financial contributions to advance the museum&#8217;s mission. (While you are thinking about it, why not give it a try and see for yourself how easy it is! If you need to find it, the give now button is also always accessible from the museum&#8217;s <a title="MMWC homepage" href="http://www.mathers.indiana.edu/" target="_blank">homepage</a>.) The museum&#8217;s strategic agenda will require additional financial support and, for this reason, a growing portion of my time is being spent connecting with donors, prospective donors, and university (and foundation) administrators laying the groundwork for new development work. The newsletter and the give now button are both key elements for this effort.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Developing a social media strategy is another related kind of infrastructure work. This is a rapidly changing sector, but we now have a working plan in place. The museum is connecting via a number of platforms. The distinctive ways that we intend to (try to) use each of them would make for a post of its own, but I can note here that the MMWC can be found on <a title="MMWC on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mathers-Museum-of-World-Cultures/153705734715810" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, on <a title="MMWC on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/MathersMuseum" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, on <a title="MMWC on G+" href="https://plus.google.com/114838969253059340577/posts" target="_blank">Google+</a>, on <a title="MMWC on Pinterest" href="http://pinterest.com/mathersmuseum/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, and on <a title="MMWC on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathers_museum/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. If you are using one of these services, I hope that you will follow (like, etc.) the MMWC there. We are eager to keep up with you and to help you keep up with all that is happening at the museum and in the larger worlds in which the museum works. (The museum does not yet have a blog, but this space can serve that function for the time being.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">As noted above, we are trying out Issuu for a fancy and social media-friendly presentation of the newsletter. (As <a title="Issuu in wikipedia english" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issuu" target="_blank">Wikipedia describes</a> it: Issuu is an &#8220;online service that allows for realistic and customizable viewing of digitally uploaded material, such as portfolios, books, magazine issues, newspapers, and other print media.)&#8221; As those consulting our newsletter there will discover, Issuu is presently very popular with American museums, who (like we are) use it to share their newsletters and magazines. &#8220;But these services come and go!&#8221; you say. &#8220;What about preservation for the future?&#8221; you rightly ask. Here is where our partnerships with the IU Bloomington Library are crucial. As noted above, the newsletter will be placed into the <a title="MMWC in IUScholarWorks Repository" href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/15356" target="_blank">IUScholarWorks Repository</a>. While it is not there yet (give us a bit of time to make sure that there are no bugs in the new newsletter), you can find some recent MMWC content there. As my example, I invite you to check out the small book that we recently published on the occasion of the <a title="Treasures of the Mathers Museum in IUScholarWorks Repository" href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/15561" target="_blank"><em>Treasures of the Mathers Museum</em></a> exhibition. (Kudos to its author, MMWC Curator Ellen Sieber.) We are presently digitizing the museum&#8217;s publications archive and making these older works accessible in IUScholarWorks. In this form, they have stable <a title="URI in wikipedia english" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier" target="_blank">URI</a>s and will be looked after digitally by the awesome folks at the library.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I could keep going along these lines, but let me close with a behind-the-scenes example. This past week, Ellen Sieber finalized work on internal protocols and strategies for our enterprise use of <a title="Zotero website" href="http://www.zotero.org/" target="_blank">Zotero</a>, the award winning research tool for &#8220;collecting, organizing, citing, and sharing&#8221; research sources. We are already making great use of this tool as we pursue research and planning work together as a staff and community. Our student practicum students have been valued colleagues in getting this piece of our infrastructure up and running. In our strategic plan, we identify buildingÊ a research <a title="Collaboratory in wikipedia english" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboratory" target="_blank">collaboratory</a> as a key goal. Our getting going with Zotero as an enterprise system is a good step forward on this goal. (Thanks Ellen!)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">As will be suggested by this partial accounting of our recent infrastructure building (/choosing) work, we are already on a bazaar-like path (after Eric Raymond&#8217;s contrastive image of the <a title="Raymond's cathedral and the bazaar in its First Monday version" href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/578/499" target="_blank">cathedral and the bazaar</a>), splicing together a range of basic off-the-rack tools and strategies (rather than waiting and building a large customized multipurpose tool and approach). This strategy is familiar to me from my work on <a title="Open Folklore website" href="http://openfolklore.org/" target="_blank">Open Folklore</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Please join us in this work. Share your good ideas and your experiences. Let us know what is working and what isn&#8217;t.</p>
